description: Involved in two notable projects. Firstly, implemented an interface between 2 Realty listing systems. Tasked with developing a WCF client for one API, I managed complex data transfer between the two, necessitating intricate mapping between disparate data structures and flows. Secondly, contributed to the backend development of an online cashless betting system tailored for golfers. While the service has since evolved, I played a pivotal role in implementing its initial availability. The system, known as PayCaddyÂ®, can be accessed at https://www.paycaddy.co.za
highlights:
    Created integration between GoCanvas mobile forms API and Private Property listings API.
    GoCanvas API (https://www.gocanvas.com).
    Private Property API (https://www.privateproperty.co.za).
    Extensive use of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).
    No project repo accessible due to NDA.
    Designed complex mapping system to convert collections of properties to realty listing objects.
    Exposure to SMS and payment gateway systems and APIs.
    Worked from home.
