			<h1>My Portfolio Website</h1>
			<p>
				I am a full stack software engineer and programmer from Johannesburg, South Africa. I use both terms because I believe they describe different aspects of producing software.

				the <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a> framework, that allows very neat separation of content and presentation concerns.
