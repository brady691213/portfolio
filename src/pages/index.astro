        <h1>My Portfolio Website</h1>
        <p>
            I am a full stack software engineer and programmer from Johannesburg, South Africa. 
            I use both terms because I believe each describes a different aspect of software creation, 
            and I hope you'll enjoy exploring my views on these topics through this website. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently recovering from a major surge of interest in purely frontend development, I've become particularly
            fascinated with the <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>
            static website framework. This allows very neat separation of content and presentation concerns. This
            website of mine is based on Astro.
        </p>
        <p>
            It also allows me a timeout to learn the TailwindCss design framework, which is a little bit harder than I
            bargained for. That is why this site
            is still so plain.
        </p>
