    <h1>My Portfolio Website</h1>
    <p>
        I am a full stack software engineer and programmer from Johannesburg, South Africa. I use both terms because I
        believe each describes a different aspect of software creation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently recovering from a major surge of interest in purely frontend development, I've become particularly fascinated with the <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>
        static website framework. This allows very neat separation of content and presentation concerns. This website of mine is based on Astro.
    </p>
    <p>
        It also allows me a timeout to learn the TailwindCss design framework, which is a little bit harder than I bargained for. That is why this site 
        is still so plain.
